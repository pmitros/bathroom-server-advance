<h1> Technology </h1>

<p>To put together the bathroom server required a unique mix of
engineering and good ol' fashioned Southern know-how. A unique blend
of MIT mechanical, electronic, civil and computer engineers came
together to build this product.

<h2> Detecting bathroom use </h2>

Each bathroom is installed with a
robotic head. The robot's combination of sensors and artificial
intelligence allows it to detect when a bathroom is in use in
real-time. The video is then transmitted to a Cray XMP supercomputer
for further analysis and refinement of the robotic system. To ensure
privacy, we use sophisticated cryptography techniques to ensure that
only a small select group of trusted individual have access (Andrei,
Shmike and Robert), who are trusted not to abuse it.</td></tr></table>

<img align=right src=map.gif> <h2> Tracing back room locations </h2>
<p>
When viewed internally from the dorm, the bathroom server displays the
path from the user's room to the nearest empty bathroom. The first
step towards doing this is to determine the user's room.
<p>
To do this, we have five servers located around the dorm. Each of
these servers sends a ping packet to the client machine. The client
machine responds with a pong packet. The time between when the ping is
sent and when the pong is received tells us how long it takes the
packets to travel through the ether in the dorm (ether is a substance
that permeates all of space. It was postulated in the 1500s,
discounted in the early 1900s, and then proven to exist with the
creation of ethernet in the 1970s). The distances to the servers let
us triangulate the approximate positions of the machines in the
dorm. We also used more advanced packet interferometry techniques that
are beyond the scope of this document.

<p> Bright readers might observe that we only need three servers to
triangulate a location in 3d. While correct, we have two redundant
servers for added robustness and accuracy. Sadly, fluctuations in the
ether may distort out readings in much the same way as temperature
layers in the water distort sonar measurements. If we misread your
room, please e-mail us, and we will recalibrate our equipment (ether
is fairly stationary, so the fix should be fairly permanent. 

<h2> Plotting shortest path </h2>
<p><img align=left src=path.gif>

Normally, finding the closest bathroom and finding the path to it is
an NP-hard problem (computationally very difficult), and we would not
have been able to compute it in real-time on our server.

<p> To solve this problem quickly and easily, we rely on Kirkoff's
Current Law, which states that electricity always takes the shortest
path between two points. We run a small current from one bathroom
location to another, and use magnetics to trace back the electron
flow.

<h1> Details </h1>

<p> Some people may want technical details for amusement or setting up
their own bathroom server. As such, we have: 

<ul>
<li> Board schematics
<li> Code for interfacing a computer to the boards
<li> Code for the web cgi-script
</ul>
