Directory structure: 

/bathroom contains the images and html files that go in the /bathroom
directory on my web server. Might make sense to rename this on the
normal server at some point, but it really doesn't matter.

/cgi-bin contains the obvious. 

/src/client contains the client source. Compile with: 
  gcc *.c

/src/data contains things needed to recreate the data files. moira.pl
extracts info from moira (could be better written using stella, about
which I found out later). This gets all the info we *MAY* need, since
I didn't want to hose the moira DB if we decided to add something else
later. pt.pl cleans it up into the format we want. bath*.tif are the
raw images of a Random Hall with and without all the
connections. cutter.pl breaks it up into the appropriate
files. output-ascii.c is if you ever want to add this into the text
mode version :)

Kludge zones, TODOs, etc.: 

* At the moment, the CGI script counts on the bathroom server to
  respond. This should not be a problem when they are both on the same
  machine. The way I (should have) dealt with it when running on my
  machine was to configure Apache to have a time limit waiting for CGI
  scripts (this is apparently an option somewhere), or to write better
  code :)

* There's a whole bunch of white .gif and green .gifs. These could be
  replaced with a single 1x1 white and a single 1x1 green gif, and
  loaded using height and width tags. Several of the other .gifs are
  probably also identical. Several could be combined. Some could be 
  replaced with &nbsp; and just give a background color for the cell 
  and height/width tags for the cell. Again, could be cleaned up. All
  this would speed up loading. 

* Should have a way to set a cookie to mark if you're in the wrong
  room. Pity that. 

* Ideally, the whole server should have a cookie to select which
  interface you go to by default.

* Technology section should at some point document ports on which to
  interface to the server and stuff like that. Pity that. 

* I should add a [help] section that documents what all the icons
  mean.

* Better graphics. 

Feel free to modify anything as you see fit. 

Enjoy,
